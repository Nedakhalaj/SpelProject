# Tic-Tac-Toe – Java Console Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java as a learning project to practice object-oriented programming, game logic, and user input handling.

The game is played in the console and supports two players taking turns.

## Project Structure

- `Main.java` – Starts the game and controls the main flow
- `Game.java` – Contains the main game logic
- `Player.java` – Represents a player and their symbol (X or O)
- `Table.java` – Manages the game board
- `InputHandler.java` – Handles user input and validation

## Features

- Two-player mode (X and O)
- Turn-based gameplay
- Input validation
- Win and draw detection
- Clean and simple console interface

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What I Learned

- Structuring a Java project using multiple classes
- Implementing game logic and conditions
- Working with user input and validation
- Using OOP concepts such as classes, methods, and encapsulation

## How to Run

1. Open the project in your Java IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)
2. Run the `Main.java` file
3. Follow the instructions in the console to play

This project is part of my learning journey in mobile application development and programming fundamentals.
